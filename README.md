# Planetary Modelling

A model of a planetary system in Python. Started as a project for first year computational laboratory, but I am working on adding my own features.

<h2> Binary Sytstem </h2>

A system of two planets orbiting eachother.




<h2> Planetary system with central body </h2>

A system with multiple planets orbiting one central body (simulating our solar system, with the planets orbiting the Sun)
